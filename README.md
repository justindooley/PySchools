# PySchools
*Please note, I have both Overall Average Score and Overall % Passing. The instructions and the example were unclear for the disctrict summary. So, I just used both.  
* For the school summary, the % Overall Passing Rate doesn't show up on GitHub for some reason, but it will show up if you download it and open it in Jupyter Notebook.
