# PySchools
* Please note, I have both Overall Average Score and Overall % Passing for the disctrict summary. The instructions and the example were unclear. So, I just used both.  
* For the school summary, the % Overall Passing Rate doesn't show up on GitHub for some reason, but it will show up if you download it and open it in Jupyter Notebook. 

# Analysis
* The bottom five schools are district schools while the top five are charter schools. 
* For most, the per student spending is higher in bottom performing schools than top performing. 
* Schools with student populations under 2,000 have higher passing rates.
